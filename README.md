# Breast-Cancer-Prediction
Model trained to predict Breast Cancer as Benign(B) or Malignant(M) based on parameters like radius, texture, perimeter etc. 

The project uses the KMeans Unsupervised Learning Model to create cluster centers which indicate datapoints for 
which the diagnosis is either B(Benign : 0) or M(Malignant : 1)
